# mybooks
mybooks is a terminal mode program written in C++ that polls the internet for basic data about a book based on ISBN number and then stores the information in a database. It can be used to quickly create a database file for your personal library that you can then manipulate with other programs. mybooks depends on the cURLpp, Jsonpp, sqlite3, and the sqlite_modern_cpp libraries which are all commonly available in most distribution repositories or on GitHub. Contributions to the project are very much welcome as are any suggestions for how to improve the program.
