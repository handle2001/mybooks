# mybooks
mybooks is a terminal mode program written in C++ that polls the internet for basic data about a book based on ISBN number and then stores the information in a database. It can be used to quickly create a database file for your personal library that you can then manipulate with other programs. mybooks depends on the cURLpp, Jsonpp, sqlite3, and the sqlite_modern_cpp libraries which are all commonly available in most distribution repositories or on GitHub.
